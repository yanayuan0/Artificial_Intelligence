How does your better heuristic improve on blocking (while maintaining
admissibility)?

Our better heuristic improves on blocking by providing another check to see whether the rows ahead of 
the zero car has cars that are in the same column as the zero car and could not be moved left or right because it has
wall or other cars on the left and right to block it. Since we know that all the cars in front of
the zero car should be horizontal or the zero car cannot get out, then we check whether those cars are blocked
by cars or walls on the left and right. If those cars are blocked on the left and right, then we need to at least move
the cars around them first, and then we could move those cars that have the same column with the zero car. Our better 
heuristic have counted the moves that include moving the cars around the cars that block zero cars on the top rows which 
blocking heuristic does not count, and we also maintain admissibility because moving the cars around
the cars that block the zero cars are steps that are required in playing the game and the better heuristic 
is an underestimate of the traffic game. 

If you implemented the bonus heuristic, how does it improve on
Manhattan (while maintaining admissibility)?
